This a Python based Portal project with DataBase and GUI where
Corporator and share its problem and then Innvator can give
its solution.
I have used the Tkinter module to for GUI.
For the DataBase, I have used simple file handling.

###Requirements##

Your System must have Python 3.6  or above installed.
Tkinter comes preinstalled in python. If in a case it's
not installed you can do a pip install to install tkinter
in your System.

I have also included a .exe file for if in a case you want
to test this project and have not installed python on your 
system, in that case you can run the .exe file(Used the 
Pyinstaller to build the .exe file from a .py file)
